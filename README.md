# Leetcode-Problems
Welcome to the Daily Coding Problems repository! In this repository, you will find a collection of daily coding problems to challenge and improve your programming skills.

- [Problem 1- Two Sum Problem](https://github.com/hamzaiftkhar/Leetcode-Problems/tree/main/Problem-01) - Given an array of integers and a target, find two numbers in the array that add up to the target.

- [Problem 2- Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://github.com/hamzaiftkhar/Leetcode-Problems/tree/main/Problem-02) - Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in `nums`.

- [Problem 3- Remove Element](https://github.com/hamzaiftkhar/Leetcode-Problems/tree/main/Problem-03) - Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` in `nums` in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val`.

- [Problem 4- Search Insert Position](https://github.com/hamzaiftkhar/Leetcode-Problems/tree/main/Problem-04) - Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order. You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

- [Problem 5- Plus One](https://github.com/hamzaiftkhar/Leetcode-Problems/tree/main/Problem-05) - Given a **non-empty** array of decimal digits representing a non-negative integer, increment one to the integer. The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list, and each element in the array contains a single digit. You must write an algorithm with `O(n)` runtime complexity.

- [Problem 6- Pascal's Triangle](https://github.com/hamzaiftkhar/Leetcode-Problems/tree/main/Problem-06) - Given an integer `numRows`, return the first `numRows` of Pascal's triangle. In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown.

- [Problem 7- Merge Two Sorted Arrays](https://github.com/hamzaiftkhar/Leetcode-Problems/tree/main/Problem-07) - Given two sorted integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, merge `nums2` into `nums1` as one sorted array. The number of elements initialized in `nums1` and `nums2` are `m` and `n` respectively. You must write an algorithm with `O(m + n)` runtime complexity.

- [Problem 8- Single Number](https://github.com/hamzaiftkhar/Leetcode-Problems/tree/main/Problem-08) - Given a non-empty array of integers `nums`, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one. You must write an algorithm with `O(n)` runtime complexity and `O(1)` extra space complexity.

- [Problem 9- Majority Element](https://github.com/hamzaiftkhar/Leetcode-Problems/tree/main/Problem-09) - Given an array `nums` of size n, return the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array. You must write an algorithm with `O(n)` runtime complexity and `O(1)` extra space complexity.
