# Single Number

Given a non-empty array of integers `nums`, every element appears twice except for one. Implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

## Example

### Example 1:
```python
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```

### Example 2:
```python
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

### Example 3:
```python
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
```

## Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4
- -3 * 10^4 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 10^4
- Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.
